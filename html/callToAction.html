    <h2>Student athletes feel more connected in school and this tends to benefit their academic success</h2>
    <p> Students who are more engaged in school tend to exceed in school at a higher rate compared to those that are not engaged. Looking at the figure below, you can see that students who are engaged in the classroom exceeded in all subjects, math, and reading at a rate that is 129%, 39%, and 170% higher, respectively, than those that aren't engaged. This data supports the idea that student athletes may exceed in school since they rank themselves as being more engaged and connected than their non student athlete peers, which can be seen by clicking the button to the left of the graph.</p>
