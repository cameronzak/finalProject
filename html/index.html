    <h1>Final Project Topic: Student Athletes</h1>
    <p>Student-athletes have to manage the time, pressure, and physical and mental challenges of playing a sport while also taking classes. How does their undergraduate experience affect their academic success? </p>
    
    <p>I chose this topic because I am a student athlete so this topic is very relatable for me. I am interested to see how playing a sport in college affects someone and if their experiences as an athlete cause a large difference in their academic success compared to non student athletes. </p>
