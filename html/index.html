    <h1>Final Project Topic: Student Athletes</h1>
    <p>Student-athletes have to manage the time, pressure, and physical and mental challenges of playing a sport while also taking classes. How does their undergraduate experience affect their academic success? I chose this topic because I am a student athlete so this topic is very relatable for me. I am interested to see how playing a sport in college affects someone and if their experiences as an athlete cause a large difference in their academic success compared to non student athletes. I personally think that being a student athlete has caused me to be a better student so it will be interesting to see whether there is data out there that supports my idea. </p>
