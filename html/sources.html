<a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/shared-ncaa-research-data">NCAA Shared Data</a>

    <p>My first data set is from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). This source is reliable because the NCAA is the national organization of college sports and has many regulations for the sports and atheltes. All athletes that compete for a Division 1 school are registered and acknowledged through the NCAA which allows them to compile data on the individuals. The NCAA has a relationship with all athletic programs and their institution which allows them to also provide data about the student body as a whole. </p>

    <p>Polls were developed by Gallup and data was collected to show numerous trends when comparing student athletes to non student athletes in various topics</p>

<a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/267740/engagement-hope-positively-influence-student-outcomes.aspx">Gallup Poll: Engagement and Education</a>
    <p> Gallup collected to data to show how students who are more engaged in school excel at higher rates than those who are not engaged. This source is a supporting source to the two sources above because it allows for the connection between student athletes and their academic success. This source is reliable because it is a widely known sophisticated source of data. They conduct numerous polls and display the data publicly for anyone to access.</p>
