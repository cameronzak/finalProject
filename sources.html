    <p>My first data set is from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). This source is reliable because the NCAA is the national organization of college sports and has many regulations for the sports and atheltes. All athletes that compete for a Division 1 school are registered and acknowledged through the NCAA which allows them to compile data on the individuals. The NCAA has a relationship with all athletic programs and their institution which allows them to also provide data about the student body as a whole. </p>

    <p>This data set provides data for all Division 1 schools and separates each school by the sport. This data set looks at Academic Progress Rate. This source still uses NCAA data but is a secondary source of the data. Data was used to calculate a single score. </p>
